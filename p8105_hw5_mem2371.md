## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicides_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicides.csv",
           na = "") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
      ),
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    date = as.Date(paste(reported_date, "01", sep = ""), "%Y%m%d")
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

The Washington Post data on homicides in 50 large US cities contains
52178 rows and 2 variables (including the city\_state and new date
variables, which has been constructed in the above code). The data
contains important information regarding homicides, such as the victim’s
first and last name, race, age, sex, location of incident (including
city and state), and the status of the case.

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicides_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>%  pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>%  pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate …

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high))
```

## Problem 3

Need to simulate a sample and conduct a t-test within the function.
Then, combine this function with a map statement. The following code is
to build the initial function, and make sure it works when setting mu =
0.

``` r
sim_ttest2 = function(samp_size = 30, mu, sigma = 5) {
  
  sim_data = 
    tibble(
      x = rnorm(n = samp_size, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
    )
  
  sim_data %>% 
    t.test() %>% 
    broom::tidy()
}

sim_results = 
  rerun(10, sim_ttest2(mu = 0)) %>% 
  bind_rows()
```

``` r
sim_results = 
  rerun(10, sim_ttest2(mu = 0)) %>% 
  bind_rows()
```

The next code chunk sets mu as 0:6, to create a finalized dataset.

``` r
sim_tres = 
  tibble(
  mu = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = mu, ~ rerun(10, sim_ttest2(mu = .x))),
    estimate_df = map(output_lists, bind_rows)
  ) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_df) %>% 
  rename(mu_hat = estimate) %>% 
  select(mu, mu_hat, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(
    rejected = case_when(
      p.value <= 0.05 ~ "yes",
      p.value > 0.05  ~ "no"
      ))
```

### Plot 1

The plot below illustrates power and the true value of mu.

``` r
sim_prop = 
  sim_tres %>% 
  group_by(mu, rejected) %>% 
  filter(rejected == "yes") %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(
    prop = count / 10
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'mu' (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
sim_prop %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = prop)) +
  geom_point()
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_mem2371_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="90%" />

## Plot 2

The plot below illustrates the average estimate of mu on the x-axis, and
the true value of mu on the y-axis.

``` r
sim_avg = 
  sim_tres %>%
  group_by(mu) %>%
  summarize(
    mu_avg = mean(mu_hat)
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
sim_avg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = mu_avg)) +
  geom_point()
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_mem2371_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="90%" />

## Plot 3

The plot below illustrates the average estimate of mu on the x-axis
within samples where the null was rejected, and the true value of mu on
the y-axis.

``` r
sim_avg_rej = 
  sim_tres %>%
  group_by(mu) %>%
  filter(rejected == "no") %>% 
  summarize(
    mu_avg_rej = mean(mu_hat))
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
sim_avg_rej %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = mu_avg_rej)) +
  geom_point()
```
